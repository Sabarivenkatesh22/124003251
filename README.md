**The code is master branch**

**I apologize for the delay in submitting my work. I kindly request that you consider my submission as I have completed both questions. 
It took some time to save the screenshots, and these questions were challenging for a beginner.
Nonetheless, I have exerted my best effort to provide the most accurate solutions. 
Thank you for your understanding.**

1. train API - to start (node index.js)
 - I apologize for the inconvenience caused. I made multiple attempts to retrieve the access_token from the respective URL, but unfortunately, due to time constraints,
   I was unable to obtain it. As a result, I had to resort to hardcoding the bearerToken. I acknowledge that this is a flaw in my submission.
   I kindly request that you take this into consideration while evaluating my work.
- SO as a outcome I want you to only change the bearer token when testing the code.
  
   Thank you for your understanding.

2. Number_management API - to start (node server.js)
   - To check whether the URL is valid or not I checked the status code if it is betweeen 200 and 300 then its avalid URL.
   - And to merge the result I have added the data to a set to remove duplicates and sort it to match the response.
